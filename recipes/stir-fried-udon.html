        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Boil a pot of hot water. Drop your pre-packaged udon noodles in the
            pot and wait 1-2 minutes until the noodles are cooked and chewy. Cut
            vegetables of your choice (I personally like cabbage and mushrooms).
            Prepare protein of choice (I prefer beef chunks). Create a noodle sauce
            by mixing together soy sauce, garlic, mirin, or any other flavors you
            want. Add the noodles, sauce, meat and vegetables into a large frying
            pan and start stir frying until the noodles are golden brown. Enjoy!
