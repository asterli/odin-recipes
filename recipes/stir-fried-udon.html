        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Stir-fried udon is popular both in the Guangdong province of China (where
            my family is from) and in Japan (aka yakiudon). My grandma knows this is
            my favorite dish and loves to make it for me when I visit her. She cooks
            the Cantonese-style version and it leaves my stomach warm and happy.
